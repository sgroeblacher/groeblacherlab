# Open positions

At the Groeblacher Lab we have a vision: we thrive to be an inclusive place where a diverse mix of talented people want to come, to learn, to live their passion and do their best work. We are dedicated to promoting equality, creating a safe environment for everyone, and believe deeply in diversity of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin, age, socioeconomic background and all the other fascinating characteristics that make us different. We truly think diversity is a strength and working in a diverse environment, and being exposed to a variety of perspectives makes us stronger scientists and better human beings.

We are continuously looking for excited and talented (applied) physics and engineering students to join our team. We are interested in people with a curious nature, a healthy appetite for theoretical challenges and the desire to learn new skills in a dynamic environment. It’s a plus if you already have some experience or had exposure to optics, cryogenics, microwave circuits, finite element simulations or microfabrication but not a requirement – these are all techniques you will learn when working with us! In our lab, we have a culture of hands-on mentoring, with an eye towards learning and growth.

Currently, we have one open PhD and one Postdoc position and are always happy hear from prospective Master students. If you have more questions please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:s.groeblacher@tudelft.nl). Looking forward to hearing from and about you! Looking forward to hearing from you!
