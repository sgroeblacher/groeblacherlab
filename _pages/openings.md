# Open positions

We are continuously looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

People with a strong experimental background, a healthy appetite for theoretical challenges and the desire to learn new skills in a dynamic environment should apply. It’s a plus if you already have some experience in optics, cryogenics, microwave circuits, finite element simulations or microfabrication but not a requirement – these are all techniques you will learn when working with us!

We currently have one open PhD and one Postdoc position and are always happy hear from prospective Master students. If you have more questions please feel free to send me an [email](mailto:s.groeblacher@tudelft.nl). Looking forward to hearing from you!
